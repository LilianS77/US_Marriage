# Who Stays Single? Exploring the Factors Behind Non-Marriage in the United States in 2023: Low Income and Education Levels Correlate with Higher Propensity to Remain Unmarried

## Overview

This study examines the socio-demographic factors influencing non-marriage in the United States in 2023 through logistic regression analysis of individual-level data. The findings show that individuals with lower income and education levels, particularly those without a bachelorâ€™s degree, are more likely to remain unmarried. Additionally, gender and race significantly influence outcomes, with men and certain racial groups, such as African Americans, experiencing higher rates of non-marriage. These results highlight structural inequities and socio-economic barriers affecting marital patterns and identify areas for potential policy action.
