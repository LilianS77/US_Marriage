# FactorsBehind Non-Marriage in the United States

## Overview

This study examines the socio-demographic determinants of non-marriage in theUnited States using logistic regression analysis on individual-level data. The find-ings highlight that individuals with lower income and education levels, particularlybelow a bachelorâ€™s degree, are significantly more likely to remain unmarried. Ad-ditionally, gender and race also play critical roles, with men and certain racialgroups, such as African Americans, showing higher unmarried rates. These re-sults underscore structural inequities and socio-economic barriers shaping maritaloutcomes, offering insights into broader societal patterns and potential areas forintervention.
