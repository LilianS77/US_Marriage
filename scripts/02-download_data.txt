How to Extract 2023 ACS Data from IPUMS

To obtain data from IPUMS, I start by navigating to the IPUMS USA section and clicking on Get Data. Next, I go to the Select Sample section, where I uncheck the "Default sample from each year" option and instead select 2023 ACS. After selecting our sample, I proceed to add variables of interest. For individual-level data, I might add variables from the Person section. For example, under Demographic, I could include variables like AGE, and under Person, I could add SEX, RACE, INCTOT (total personal income) and EDUC (education attainment). Once our variables are selected, I click View Cart, then proceed by clicking Create Data Extract. At this point, I review our selections, change the Data Format to CSV, and submit our extract for processing. Then I saved it locally as usa_00001.csv.
